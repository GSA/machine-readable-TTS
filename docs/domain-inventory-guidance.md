## Process

* From the 'Current Federal' [list of domains](https://github.com/GSA/data/blob/master/dotgov-domains/current-federal.csv) in the .gov registry, filter for agency="General Services Administration", and review for which domains we know that TTS programs operate.  
* Update [this inventory file](https://github.com/GSA/machine-readable-TTS/blob/master/data/domains.yml).  


## Proposals

* Engage with the .gov registry to update and normalize the 'Organization' field for all of the domains that TTS manages so that they all say "Technology Transformation Services".  This would then allow us to use the [original source file](https://github.com/GSA/data/blob/master/dotgov-domains/current-federal.csv) directly.
