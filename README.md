## The Machine Readable TTS working group

Mission: For all of the information of and about TTS to be available as an automated, machine-readable form.  

## Call to Action

* Everyone in TTS: Add to [the list of data](https://github.com/GSA/machine-readable-TTS/blob/main/directory/datasets.md) that your program needs or would use
* Relevant Programs: 
  1. Document how any requested datasets that have been requested of your program can be accessed live and automatically.
  2. For any requested data that you are responsible that isn't currently avialable to the team in a machine-readable form, outline a plan for how you could get there.  If you'd like help planning or implementing this, ask in #wg-machine-readable

## Guiding Principles
* Any TTS data that leadership or fellow programs need in order to do their jobs well should be available at all times in a machine-readable form
* Any TTS data that isn't currently available in that way should develop a plan for becoming machine-readable and accessible to the team
* The methodology by which the data is accessible doesn't matter.  There's [many options](https://github.com/GSA/machine-readable-TTS/blob/main/docs/methods.md). What matters is that the data be available in real-time and able to be consumed programatically.
